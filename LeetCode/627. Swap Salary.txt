# Write a solution to swap all 'f' and 'm' values (i.e., change all 'f' values to 'm' and vice versa) with a single update statement and no intermediate temporary tables.
# Note that you must write a single update statement, do not write any select statement for this problem.


# Swap value with a conditon 
# CASE WHEN THEN END => like a if else statement.
# Write your MySQL query statement below
UPDATE Salary
SET sex = CASE
            WHEN sex = 'f' THEN 'm'
            WHEN sex = 'm' THEN 'f'
        END;





# Another approce 
# first i can make  two table (f nad m table)
# Then change their sex value
# finally UNION those table.
